# Simulation Core
The core of empyrean, handles the physics calculations and simulation loop.
 - [ ]  Add support for more integretors (Verlet, Runge-Kutta IV, etc)
 - [ ]  Optimize reduction in CUDA kernels ([Ref](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/assets/cuda/files/reduction.pdf))
 - [ ]  Add [Barns-Hut](http://arborjs.org/docs/barnes-hut) approximation algorithm 
 - [ ]  Implement SI units and prefixes and scale units automatically


# Rendering and Visualization
The rendering component handles the visualization of the particles and the simulation.
 - [ ] Render anti-aliased circular points
 - [ ] Add more camera controls
 - [ ] Support pause/resume and controlling simulation speed 
 - [ ] Support Vulkan
 - [ ] Display FPS and other details on window
 - [ ] Provide a user interface, before rendering to control simulation parameters
 - [ ] Motion blur for fast moving points


# Common
 - [ ] Add documentation
